# Analogy

Think of the system as an air traffic control tower:
- The frontend is the radar screen—shows aircraft and plans.
- FastAPI is the controller—validates requests and issues instructions.
- Algorithms are the pilots—fly routes (alignments/paths) using different aircraft (classical vs quantum).
- MongoDB is the flight log—records each flight’s route, timing, and status.
- Jobs are flight plans—filed, updated, and closed upon landing.

Different aircraft (Smith-Waterman, Viterbi, QAOA, QCNN) trade off speed, fuel, and precision depending on the journey length and weather (sequence size and constraints).
